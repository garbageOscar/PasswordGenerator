# PasswordGenerator
Very simple password generator in Java called HelloWorld!.

This easy to read and understand java program will crash if the input isn't PRECISE.

(How to Use)
Running the application will present two dialogs.  The first one being:

***Enter password length: 8, 12, 16 (recommended), 24, 36, 128

(The user should input his or her choice for a password length.)

The second dialog takes a boolean, where the user MUST fully type TRUE or FALSE:

***(boolean) Would you like extended ASCII characters (ride or die)?

(Again, the user must FULLY TYPE either TRUE or FALSE.  FALSE is recommended -- for now.)

You're welcome and let's make progress together.
